								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Business confidence high following FMN new Dealer Strategy<br />
</strong></p>
<p>FMN unveiled its new business partner strategy and rewarded key dealers for their patronage and performance at a grand gala event last night in Lagos. The event which was attended by over 500 guests, culminated in the handing over of 17 trucks to the top performing dealers. The top 5 Dealers were celebrated with the special award of 30-ton trucks and trailers which further expands their business model with primary distribution capability.</p>
<p>In a manner that has become synonymous with FMN, business partners and key dealers from across Nigeria were celebrated and acknowledged for their loyalty and contributions to the FMN business.</p>
<p>This year’s conference theme and subject of a business review, “Breakthrough partnering for growth,” looked back at the rich and unique heritage the company shares with its partners and reinforced the continued commitment towards mutual profitability and growth.</p>
<p>The conference commenced with an interactive session, where FMN outlined its strategy on delivering sustainable and consistent growth while working closely with dealers and partners to overcome and solve common business challenges.</p>
<p>Devlin Hainsworth, MD, Foods division, at FMN, commented:</p>
<p>“After nearly sixty years of doing business in Nigeria, we can say that there are very few companies in Nigeria today, who understand the business environment as we do. FMN has a culture of winning, that is backed with a robust portfolio of quality products many bearing the Golden Penny name, and sound consumer and market fundamentals that are necessary to drive sustainable future growth. “</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<p>“What makes us different is our long-term and innovative approach to partnership. We have a dynamic and interdependent relationship with our Trade Partners and this has resulted in the sustained growth of our businesses. This is an exciting and challenging time and we are totally committed to evolving the relationship that we enjoy with our partners. The breakthrough lies in how we think and act together with our partners. We are now more actively engaged in jointly identifying business opportunities downstream and then unlocking these for mutual benefit and greater customer and consumer satisfaction. We will build further on this approach and with other innovative ideas to ensure future success.”</p>
<p>Paul Gbededo, Group Managing Director, FMN commented:</p>
<p>“Our success story as the leading consumer business in Nigeria, will not be complete without our esteemed dealers and partners who form an integral part of how we are achieving our purpose of feeding the nation every day.’ As we continue to look towards the future, our aim is essentially to promote stronger ties with our partners, because we know that the sustainability and future growth of our business depend on it.”</p>
<p>He adds:</p>
<p>“The rewards that we are presenting to the dealers today, will in addition to recognizing their performance, greatly impact their businesses and spur them on for further growth and profitability.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nigeria’s leading food and agro-allied group, and makers of the popular Golden Penny Foods brand have been adjudged winners of Standards Organization of Nigeria (SON) high-performance award, and recipient of the coveted Mandatory Conformity Assessment Programme (MANCAP) Certification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MANCAP which was introduced by SON in 2006, is a mandatory product certification scheme designed to ensure that locally manufactured products meet the relevant Nigerian Industrial Standards (NIS).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs. Peters Enitan, The Regulatory Compliance Manager, at FMN, while commenting on the MANCAP certification, disclosed that the award was a culmination of a series of regulatory inspections conducted by SON, including a production facility tour, on-line sample collection, on the spot analysis of samples collected during inspection to check compliance to SON standards, and finally, an analysis of selected products in SON’s laboratory to ensure the enrichment of required nutrients and compliance with set standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Other aspects of the monitoring visits include compliance to Good Manufacturing Practices within our production environment, as well as the availability of relevant food safety regulatory documentation of our processes, which are sighted on inspection, and taken with them for their records.” She said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Devlin Hainsworth, MD, Foods Division, at FMN commented: “The award is in recognition of companies that have distinguished themselves in their various manufacturing and production categories. FMN’s award is for high performance and continuous improvements to the quality of our products in the Flour milling category.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As one of the leading foods and agro-allied groups in Nigeria, we are focused on ensuring that the quality of Golden Penny products continually meets consumer and customer expectations. It is what we are truly passionate about and dedicated to. It is consistent with our purpose of feeding the Nation, Everyday, and ensuring that the millions of Nigerian families who are nourished by our products are always assured of the very best quality at affordable prices” He adds.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In light of its huge potential to the development of the Nigerian economy, the Chairman of FMN, Mr John Coumantaros has highlighted the critical steps that needs to be taken to optimise the manufacturing sector in the country. He made this known in a keynote address that was delivered during the ongoing Manufacturing Equipment Expo (NME) and Manufacturing Partnership for African Development (mPAD).</p>
<p>He began by commending the organisers of the event for choosing a theme which presented a golden opportunity to tackle the numerous challenges that are bedevilling the manufacturing sector. The theme “Optimizing Value Chain to Maximize Growth and Competitiveness in the Manufacturing Sector” critically examines the potentials of a vibrant manufacturing sector, the attendant challenges and the roadmap to the manufacturing sector that is reminiscent of the age and technology that we have found ourselves. He said.</p>
<p>According to him “Holistically, manufacturing itself is essentially the main component of all value chains. Manufacturing can be accomplished through the efficient, and careful development of value chains that facilitate higher-value-added processing using locally produced inputs and services in production. For manufacturing in Nigeria to truly succeed and play its rightful role in being a significant contributor to GDP, we must look at all aspects of the value chain – from inbound Raw material procurement all the way to sales and after-sales service”.</p>
<p>While lauding varied government initiatives, the FMN Boss urged the federal government to continue to implement reforms that would attract the much-needed investments — citing the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Bank of Industry as few of the government agencies that are doing so much to boost the stamina of local industries and their opportunities to compete in a favourable environment.</p>
<p>In conclusion, he  indicated that more  can be done to help the productive sector which is central to the economy and livelihood of a millions of Nigerians.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc (“Flour Mills of Nigeria” or “FMN”), the market leader in food and agro-allied products in Nigeria, today announced its audited 2017 Financial Results with Group revenue increasing to an all-time high of N542.7 billion.</p>
<p>Key Highlights</p>
<p>• Group Revenue: N542 billion, compared to N524 billion in 2017 (3.5% Year on Year growth)<br />
• Group Operating profit: N48 billion, compared to N41 billion in 2017 (16.9% Year on Year growth)<br />
• Group Profit Before Tax: N16.4 billion, compared to N10.4 billion in 2017 (58% Year on Year growth)<br />
• Group Profit After Tax: N13.6 billion, compared to N8.8 billion, in 2017 (54.1% Year on Year growth)<br />
• The Company, Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc recorded a revenue of N389billion, compared to N375billion in 2017 (4% year on Year growth)</p>
<p>Key Operational highlights</p>
<p>• Our Food business has performed in line with our objectives on both top and bottom lines.<br />
• The results of our agro-allied businesses reflect a combination of both profitable and growing businesses (feed, fertilizer), while our latest entry into this category are yet to fully deliver according to our expectations including sugar, with our local backward integration program in Sunti, as well as our edible oil business.<br />
• BAGCO, our packaging material business, recorded very good results, maintaining its leadership position in its product categories.</p>
<p>Paul Gbededo, Group Managing Director, Comments: “Our 2017, year end result, shows a remarkable growth in the Group’s revenue of N542 billion, which represents an impressive 3.5% year on year growth. This was achieved through a combination of resilience in the face of a challenging environment, volume growth and product mix from our food and agro-allied businesses. The results are a clear indication that our efforts to continually push for improved efficiency and synergy in the Group, are yielding the expected results”.</p>
<p>In the agricultural space, we have continued to consolidate our position, with a firm commitment to lead in this space while aligning with the agricultural promotion policies in the federal and state level where we operate. We are critically looking into our investments in our backward integration initiatives and have confirmed our commitments towards future profitable growth by recapitalizing various subsidiaries. We are also impairing at company level, part of our investment in Kaboji Farm, our first agricultural investment which has now become our center of excellence for seed and best agricultural practices in maize and soybean.</p>
<p>In his comments the Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Jacques Vauthier, stated that the Group had also decided to accelerate the depreciation period of some support services assets, resulting in a onetime expense of N1.2 billion. In spite of these one-time exceptional expenses, and initial losses in some of our early stage agro-allied businesses, our Group still recorded a Profit Before Tax of N16.4 billion, confirming our commitment towards cost controls and increasing our margins.</p>
<p>“In an effort to strengthen the company’s capital base, deleverage our balance sheet, and support our working capital needs, we embarked on, and have completed a Rights Issue program during the past months. With the successful completion of the Rights Issue program, we have now positioned the Company to exploit value-accretive opportunities, whilst giving greater operational and financial flexibility to ensure business growth and continuity”.</p>
<p>We have also taken various actions towards reducing our financial expenses, including a commercial paper program. Our focused, but limited investments in capital expenditure as well as tight control over our working capital has helped us to manage our financing costs with a view to a material reduction in the coming year.</p>
<p>With this result, we remain focused on our commitment to continually create value for our customers, consumers and all key stakeholders, in furtherance of our core strategic focus of ‘Feeding the Nation, everyday.”</p>
<p><strong>UMOLU, JOSEPH A. O.</strong><br />
<strong> COMPANY SECRETARY / DIRECTOR, LEGAL SERVICES</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The need to create a safe and healthy workplace for employees should be every employer’s priority. The Lagos Vision Zero initiative aims at inculcating the mindset that all injuries and ill health arising from workplace can be prevented if managed properly. Hence, the need to find solutions to prevent injuries and ill health at the workplace.</p>
<p>The Lagos State Government, through the Lagos State Safety Commission, hosted a conference tagged Lagos Vision Zero Conference with the theme: “a mindset change towards zero harm”. According to the Director General, Lagos State Safety Commission, Hon Hakeem Dickson said the aim of the conference is to develop attitudinal change of employers towards the workers and to safeguard them while at work.</p>
<p>He also solicited for leadership commitment to the Vision Zero where every accident is preventable and support from employers and other relevant stakeholders towards efforts by the Commission to build an inclusive Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Workplace strategy for the protection and education of the workforce.</p>
<p>The safety culture of some companies in Nigeria are top notch, and Flour Mills of Nigeria is one of the organizations that make the safety of their employees their priority.</p>
<p>On Thursday June 28th 2018 at the Gala Dinner of the Conference, Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc was awarded with the first “<strong>Lagos Vision Zero</strong>” award manufacturing safety culture in acknowledgement of FMN achievements in the effort to manage occupational risks for workers in its operations and being a leader in the Journey towards “Vision Zero”.</p>
<p>The Lagos Vision Zero award was handed over to the FMN Group Head HSE Mr. Georgios Radoglou in presence of FMN HSE Environmental Manager and Authority Liaison Mr. Alu Roman. This is a great achievement and a significant acknowledgement of the strong efforts of the FMN group to change HSE culture and create a safer workplace for its employees and stakeholders.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a move that further reiterates the commitment of Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc (FMN) to be a catalyst in the transformation of Nigeria’s Agricultural sector, and in pursuance of its core strategic focus of “Feeding the Nation, Everyday,” the company today announced a strategic partnership with Corteva Agriscience<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, Agriculture Division of DowDuPont.</p>
<p>The collaboration will see FMN and Corteva Agriscience<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> working together on key aspects of the maize value chain in Nigeria, with a focus on promoting modern farming techniques and practices, capacity development and knowledge transfer for the local production and use of improved and quality inputs, including seeds and crop protection.</p>
<p>“We are excited at the prospects of this partnership, and what we can achieve,” said John Coumantaros, Chairman, FMN. “Corteva Agriscience<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is a globally renowned company with a wealth of experience in crop protection and biotechnology solutions, and will introduce new and exciting seed production techniques that will help develop the maize hybrid seed market in Nigeria. Over the years, FMN has invested heavily in the primary processing, aggregation and distribution of locally grown grains such as maize, soybean, rice, sorghum and wheat, and are passionate about strengthening the capabilities of small-scale farmers, even as we continue to seek out newer ways of deepening our supply chain.”</p>
<p>“We are currently in the sustainability testing phase for the most viable varieties suitable for this environment and envisage that the next step will be to establish in Nigeria, a world-class hybrid maize production plant,” said, Paul Gbededo, Group Managing Director, FMN.</p>
<p>“Our business is ultimately about providing for the livelihood of millions of Nigerian families, by ensuring that they have access to great food, and as such, we are focused on building a business that caters for not just their nutritional needs but enriches their lives,” added Gbededo.</p>
<p>“This partnership endorses our commitment to collaboration across the food chain to transform the role of agriculture in society and enhance the livelihood of farmers in Nigeria,” said Prabdeep Bajwa, Commercial Unit Director, Africa Middle East, Corteva Agriscience<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, Agriculture Division of DowDuPont. “Our company is investing in innovation, drawing on our knowledge of genetics, chemistry and digital to give farmers in Africa more and better products and ensuring their success.”</p>
<p>FMN and Corteva Agriscience<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> have already started work on demonstration farm plots in Nigeria to showcase high-performing hybrid maize varieties with additional test sites expected to commence soon in Kwara, Niger, Kaduna, Kano, Oyo, Nassarawa, Bauchi, Plateau States and the Federal Capital Territory.<br />
Nigeria currently has a national average maize yield of about 1.5 metric tonnes per hectare, which is significantly below the average 2 tons per hectare of maize yields in Africa and 10 tonnes per hectare in the U.S. Early projections indicate that the adoption of hybrid seed and use of improved farming inputs and techniques will increase maize yields by about 100% in the next five years.</p>
<p>The partnership also seeks to work with relevant Nigerian agencies to strengthen the legal framework for Plant Variety Protection (PVP) in intellectual property laws which will not only guarantee that the country gets access to the best technology solutions but also protect the rights of smallholder farmers.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="x_MsoNormal">The Flour Milling Association of Nigeria (FMAN) on recently donated 50 units of AMAR multi-crop threshers worth N70 million to wheat farmers to boost wheat production and the dream to achieve self-sufficiency in wheat production in Nigeria.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Speaking at a presentation ceremony held recently in Lagos, Mr. Paul Gbededo, Group Managing Director, Flour Mills of Nigeria PLC., said that the presentation was a demonstration of the association’s commitment to continuously support wheat farmers and the Federal Government’s Agriculture Promotion Policy.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“There is no gainsaying that self-sufficiency in the production of wheat in Nigeria will have an unprecedented impact on the Nigerian economy through the attainment of food security, poverty reduction and of course, save much needed foreign exchange,” he said.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The GMD disclosed further that, an MoU was signed with Wheat Farmers Association of Nigeria in 2016 to purchase all available wheat grain produced by farmers in line with agreed quality parameters and prevailing market prices.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“In 2017, FMAN fulfilled its promise by purchasing over 2,400 metric tons of wheat valued at N469 million.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“In 2018, even before the start of harvest, we have purchased over 1600 metric tons of wheat valued at N237 million.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“FMAN established a N20 million Research and Development Grant to the Lake Chad Research Institute to conduct research into enhanced wheat farming technology and modern agronomy practices aimed at improving wheat varieties with good yield,” he said.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Gbededo said that the association would continue to invest effort and resources on initiatives that would improve local supply chain.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc, (FMN Group) market leader in food and agro-allied products in Nigeria, today announced that its biggest agricultural investment in Nigeria to date – The Sunti Golden Sugar Estate will be commissioned on the 13th of March 2018 by Muhammadu Buhari, the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p>
<p>Located on the banks of River Niger, in Mokwa, Niger state, the Sunti Golden Sugar Estate is owned by Sunti Golden Sugar Estates (SGSE) Ltd. a subsidiary of Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc.</p>
<p>The sugar estate features 17, 000 hectares of irrigable farmland and a Sugar mill that process 4,500 metric tons of sugarcane per day. At full capacity, the estate is expected to produce 1 Million tons of Sugarcane which roughly translates into 100,000 metric tons of sugar yearly.</p>
<p>Enclosed within a 35-kilometer dyke, the production facility area is 15,100 hectares, with a cane area that features a maximum output of 10, 000 hectares. The dyke provides flood protection from the River Niger. Over N1 billion was invested in the state-of-the-art irrigation system that will ensure the efficient cultivation of sugar cane, with infrastructure that includes drain pumps, pump stations, and a power grid.</p>
<p>The estate is the purest representation of the Federal Government’s Nigerian Sugar Master Plan (NSMP) with an ambitious Backward integration program that intends to set Nigeria on the path to self-sufficient sugar production. The farm at peak production will provide direct employment for about 10,000 people yearly, and impact up to 50,000 people indirectly, including 3,000 small-scale out growers who will be cultivating sugarcane to feed the mill.</p>
<p>The estate has brought infrastructure benefits to the surrounding community, with 28 communities in total taking advantage of a new 30-kilometer road, plus expansive road networks that provide a variety of access routes to the homes of the indigenes. Drains, culverts, and flood-protection walls have also been constructed.</p>
<p>The project illustrates the desire to reduce sugar importation, save billions in foreign exchange, boost local capacity, and reduce unemployment by putting thousands of Nigerians to work.</p>
<p>The FMN Group’s mantra, “Feeding the Nation, Everyday,” is at the heart of the company’s strategic decisions on what they produce, how and where factories are set up, the level of care that is put into products, and how they interact with host communities and the wider environment.</p>
<p>The commissioning of the Sunti Golden Sugar Estate on March 13th will be the first step towards a collective dream of agricultural progress for all in Nigeria.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past 15 years there has been remarkable progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS and this has inspired a global push to eradicate the virus by 2030.</p>
<p>Without a cure yet, such a goal can only be achieved by creating awareness and giving education on prevention of HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>To commemorate World AIDS Day 2017, the management of Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc organized a series of activities from testing to counseling designed to sensitize and encourage their staff to engage in the discussions on HIV/AIDS. </p>
<p>It is time to unite and take action against this global disaster.</p>
<p>Of the 35 million people currently living with the virus all over the world, 3.2 million are Nigerians and while we strive to prevent new cases, we must ensure that there is adequate care; medical, social and otherwise.</p>
<p>The Group Managing Director of FMN reiterated the company’s commitment to this cause in the speech he gave during the event.</p>
<p>“We will continue to abide by our non-discriminatory policy on having HIV positive people in our employment and continue to provide the right support to our colleagues who are living with the disease.” </p>
<p>World AIDS Day is a global event held on the 1st of December each year to unite people around the world in the fight against HIV and to support people living with the virus. “Everybody counts. Right to health” was the theme for this year’s event.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In line with Northern Nigeria Flour Mills Plc’s (NNFM) vision to become the foremost processor of traditional grain cereals that offer convenience, affordability, taste and nutrition to families in Northern Nigeria, the company launched its state-of-the-art ultra-modern sorghum milling plant in Kano, the largest of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>The commissioning ceremony was attended by the Executive Governor of Kano State, His Excellency <strong>Dr</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, OFR; </strong>the Hon. Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment, <strong>Hajia, Aisha Abubakar</strong>; the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, <strong>Mal. Suleiman Barau</strong> (representing the Governor of the CBN); the Executive Director Large Enterprise, Bank of Industry, <strong>Mr. Simon Aranonu</strong> (representing the MD BoI); <strong>Representative of HRH Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II</strong>; representatives of Farmers’ Associations and other dignitaries from across various industries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Governor of Kano State, in his speech, while commending NNFM and its parent company FMN, expressed happiness on the historic and unique commissioning of the Plant, the first of its kind in the country and coming within months of Kano State Government’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Economic and Investment Summit, with common objectives of revitalizing economic activities and uplifting the welfare of citizens.</p>
<p>The Hon. Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment, in her remarks, acknowledged FMN’s role in promoting Federal Government of Nigeria’s development policies particularly in the area of agro-allied industries in the North.</p>
<p>The representatives of the CBN and the BoI were unanimous in commending NNFM and FMN for the initiative and pledged their continued support.  They noted that investments such as this are consistent with current CBN Agri Initiative, the Anchor Borrowers Scheme and other agro-allied financing schemes that create job opportunities, improve GDP growth, conserve foreign exchange and diversify the economy through the promotion of local content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chairman of FMN, <strong>Mr. John G. Coumantoros</strong>, in his Key Note Address, reaffirmed FMN’s commitment to be one of the largest promoters of Government’s Agricultural Promotion Policy with its on-going investments in agro allied initiatives in its concept of integrated food basket of products with home grown produce. The investment is meant to position NNFM as FMN Group’s hub for local content processing and value addition, a centre of Excellence on Research &amp; Development and Extension, feeding the nation every day from food produced from locally sourced raw materials and grains.  This was the vision of his late father <strong>George S.</strong> <strong>Coumantaros</strong>, who started the Mill in 1978.  He further stated that the Company intends to, in the near future, add multi-grain blending facilities to the mill.</p>
<p>The Mill, which was built at a cost of about N2billion with an installed capacity of 100,000 metric tons per annum, is another realization of the company’s strategic investment drive in Kano State and the wider Northern Nigeria and will actively empower up to 40,000 people (workers, logistics, traders, input and extension service providers) during the coming planting season, providing quality jobs, social upliftment and economic empowerment in the rural areas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was at this event that he announced an FMN project to set up a Fertilizer Blending Plant in Kaduna. The project was conceived to boost agriculture and increase the potential and production capacity of the state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMN Group, which has not just been one of the major investors in Kaduna, but the country at large, was one of the major sponsors of the summit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr John Coumantarous, in his presentation, also reeled out several strategic investment plans that the company has for the northern region especially in relation to the food and agro-allied value chain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The summit which is scheduled to end today, 6th of April 2017 had in attendance notable stakeholders from several walks of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Emir of Kano and keynote speaker, His Highness, Muhammadu Sanusi II, spoke plainly about the troubles that have bedevilled the northern region but expressed optimism for platforms like <strong>KADINVEST 2.0</strong> that is already ushering the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another landmark of the event was the signing of the <strong>Ease of Doing Business Charter</strong>, which will launch Kaduna state further into the business sphere and share of the country’s massive potential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Executive Governor of Kaduna State, Mallan Nasir El-Rufai, explained that KADINVEST 2.0 is the government’s commitment to ensuring that everything is being put in place to make business<u>es</u> thrive in the state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two-day event will come to a close today with a clear roadmap and the first steps to explore the potentials of the state and the country to their fullest.</p>

Nobody foresaw it. It was an afterthought when people started saying that it comes cyclically. If that was the case, then it would have been announced. I do not think that anybody saw it coming. At least, they would have announced it.</p>
<p>Nobody saw that $110 which was exchanged for a barrel of crude oil will become $30. We should even recall that it went below the $30 line, it went as low as $27 because it started climbing slowly. Today, a barrel of crude sells for about $50, and this is still just 50% of the journey to its original point as at the start of the year in 2014.</p>
<p>The recession hit everybody. It particularly hit the manufacturing sector very hard because we did not anticipate it. We were affected, and our performance was too but within 12 – 15 months, we readjusted. We reinvented ourselves at it were, started seeing things for the way that it should be. Our clear vision, great people, code of conduct and strategy did the magic, and today we can stand tall. In the food industry today possibly, no company can boast of a better performance.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t just a smooth ride. Let us go back a little, and I think that the nation can even learn from this. If we go back to 2014 and 2015, if you look at the numbers very well, in operations, we actually were at a loss. The bottom line was negative if we consider the operational profit. What did we do? We sold our shares in cement, and it was the income that boosted our results in 2014 and 2015. It was from this transaction that we were able to pay dividends.</p>
<p>In challenging times, organisations must weigh their options, and this was what we did to stabilise ourselves and gather the lift to move into 2015. Communication is also essential in situations like this, and we kept everyone that needed to be abreast of the current happenings. Four factors are responsible for our resilience and bloom in these times.</p>
<p>The first is that we are a very focused company. Our mission is clear and our vision. For us, there is no going back. We know what we want, and we go for it.</p>
<p>The second is that we have a tremendous asset in people. Our staff are a huge part of our secret. Their dedication, competence and devotion is amazing. After the close of work, six o clock or seven, you will still see staff around. That is ownership. Our employees are not mercenaries.</p>
<p>The third is our culture, ethics and our core values. Integrity in quality and value. When you buy anything from say, Golden Penny, you must know that it is quality. We also have a very strong team spirit.</p>
<p>At FMN, it is a combination of local talents and expatriates, but we are one big family. Because of our diversification, we tend to have silo operations, but we still team up. This is why I am the group chief servant to make sure that it is one team and we are all aligned to the policies of the company.</p>
<p>Fourthly, we ensure that we do not just jump into any business; we do our cost-benefit analysis before jumping into markets. Of course, we can have a business that we may have to re-tweak but generally speaking, we sit down and do a thorough analysis before we move into any business. A business that will bring money for the stakeholders that is what we look into.</p>
<p>These four keys have helped us to stand firm in times of headwinds and recession and challenges.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of her corporate social responsibility, FMN has started the construction of a vocational centre for special needs children in Methodist Primary School, Apapa. FMN has also committed itself to the provision of support staff for the successful running of the centre when the project is completed for at least the first year.</p>
<p>The multimillion-naira vocational centre, which presents a calculated combination of welfare and education intervention for the good of the local community, is proposed to be finished in three months.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1561" src="https://fmnplc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Picture-2.jpg" alt="Picture-2" width="1920" height="1275" srcset="https://fmnplc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Picture-2.jpg 1920w, https://fmnplc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Picture-2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://fmnplc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Picture-2-768x510.jpg 768w, https://fmnplc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Picture-2-1024x680.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>The project which will be wholly funded by FMN was recently approved by the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) and will be executed in collaboration with Care-Giver Initiative; an organisation working to promote inclusive education for the mentally and physically challenged in Nigeria.</p>
<p>A groundbreaking ceremony at the school’s premises held on Thursday, 16<sup>th</sup> March to signal the take-off of the project. Representatives of the School’s Management Team, FMN, State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Apapa Local Government Education Authority and Caregiver Initiative were present at the event.</p>
<p>Mrs G.O Aliu, the head teacher of Methodist Primary School lauded the initiative and Mrs G.A Omogunloye, the head of the Inclusive Unit, was particularly delighted, noting that the project was coming at a much-needed time. Stakeholders got acquainted with one another and discussed expectations, potentials and the completion of the project in record time.</p>
<p>Education and Welfare are core areas of FMN’s CSR focus. Others include Research and Skill Development; Environmental Sustainability; Health and Safety; Security and Infrastructural Development. This project will join hundreds of others that FMN has commissioned and completed in different parts of the country in her over five decades of operations.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The development of human resources is a key focus of the FMN group. The company invests and continues to invest in a plethora of learning initiatives to build and sharpen employees’ skills and competence through training.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one of these initiatives, <em>Shidi</em><em> Huzeinat Kehinde</em> from FMN, has emerged the first female graduate of African Milling School. The African Milling School is located in the nerve centre of East Africa in Nairobi, Kenya. It offers a broad range of comprehensive and intensive training of personnel in the milling industry. The school combines theory and practice with the aim to build up the next crop of professional millers for the continent. From the processing of raw materials to finished goods and the efficient operations for high value and yield, it also teaches maintenance and technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzeinat who was featured on the front cover of the First Issue and 128<sup>th</sup> volume of the Milling and Grain magazine says that it felt a bit funny to be the only female in the class but that the feeling was short lived because of the friendly and professional atmosphere that the school presented. The quiet twin from Lagos state who has a passion for learning new things was so excited that she was a part of the programme. She has worked with FMN for six years as an assistant Miller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the company’s set of principles and core values, PIILOT: Performance, Initiative, integrity, Leadership, Ownership and Teamwork, the company expects so much from its workforce, and from whom much is expected, much more must be given. This is why FMN has an integrated and development framework geared towards maintaining a professional and highly skilled employee base. From the graduate trainee programme to its leadership succession programmes, FMN has various learning platforms, many of which are in collaboration with national and international technical partners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The emphasis that FMN places on learning does not just ensure that the company maintains the competent workforce and right management team; it also influences the sustainable growth and development of the nation at large.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FMN started operation with flour milling in the ports of Apapa. Through the agency of its Golden Penny Brand, the company has produced a plethora of iconic food products that have nourished the country from generations to generations for more than six decades. It is the flagship of FMN; there is little wonder it is the most popular brand. Many even view Golden Penny and FMN as synonyms that can be used interchangeably.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, beyond the boundaries of food, the group of companies that is FMN also own brands that are undisputed leaders various other spheres in the agro-allied, support and logistics sectors of the economy. This article examines three well-known brands that you may have scarcely associated with FMN.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is TOP FEEDS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Produced by Premier Feeds, Top Feeds is the brand name that has become a general term for animal feed in Nigeria. It has a complete range of products that cover all aspect of animal feed requirement. In June 2010, Premier Feed Mills completed the building of Africa’s most modern, fully automated feed factory with a 300,000 tonne per year animal feed factory in Ibadan, Oyo State. Combined with other facilities that it possesses, Premiere feeds has the capacity to produce about 600,000 tonnes of animal feed in one year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the 2015/2016 year, Top feeds sold more than 400,000 tonnes of animal feed for the first time in history, surpassing the prior year sales with a growth of 25%. This volume represented the largest single company sales in the country and placed “Top Feeds” as the number one brand in Nigeria. Apart from the production of quality feeds at unbeatable prices, Top feeds advises and guides customers, on request, on all relevant feeding issues as well as farm management and animal health matters. Top feeds have a number of veterinary doctors, farm management specialists as well as nutritionists in its employ and holds frequent education programmes all across the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people recall the first company in Nigeria to produce woven polypropylene sack in Nigeria, Bagco, but very few people know that it is an FMN brand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nigerian Bag Manufacturing (BAGCO) was established as a wholly owned subsidiary company of FMN Plc. in Lagos in 1972 to provide quality sacks to support the industrial and agricultural sectors of the Nigerian economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1990, Northern Bag Manufacturing Company Limited was established in Kano to increase the capacity of sack production further and improve distribution. In 2007, BAGCO was quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and became a Plc when FMN sold 30% of its equity holding to the Nigerian public. It was during this first year as a publicly quoted company that BAGCO was awarded the NSE President’s Award for its Trade Group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a production capacity of 32 million bags monthly and many awards to show for, Bagco is a leading name in packaging solutions of businesses across the nation and the sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third brand that you may not have associated with FMN is Golden Fertilizer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike the previous two, this brand may only be familiar with farmers; nevertheless, it is the name behind most of the food that is grown in the country. Golden fertiliser is a leading brand in the agro-allied supply chain in the country. It is blended, packaged and distributed by the Golden Fertilizer Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of FMN that was established almost two decades ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than just a brand or business, Golden fertiliser represents one of FMN’s numerous commitment to establish a solid fertile base for Nigeria’s re-emerging agricultural sector in order to meet the nation’s target for self-sufficiency. The company provides a broad range of effective fertilisers for a bountiful yield on the farm. Made under the finest circumstances with the highest quality, these are the farmer’s partner for success and profit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you know what Bagco, Top Feeds and Golden Fertilizer have in common, FMN.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the city of Lagos, the 2nd December 2016 will be hard to forget. The board, management and staff of FMN; family members and friends of George Coumantaros and dignitaries and members of the general public gathered to celebrate the memorial service of GEORGE STAVROS COUMANTAROS, International Business Icon and Founding Father of FMN (Flour Mills of Nigeria) Plc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The memorial service began at about 12 noon at the Cathedral Church of Christ, Marina. The Executive Governor of Lagos State, Mr Akinwumi Ambode, hosted a plethora of national and international dignitaries. From Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto to Professor Jerry Gana, there were notable figures at every turn of the compact but exquisitely furnished church hall. In his remarks, Mr Akinwumi Ambode welcomed everyone to the occasion on behalf of the good people of Lagos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Governor spoke about Mr George Stavros Coumantros and maintained that he was not just the founding father of FMN but also a founding father of modern Lagos. He spoke about FMN’s contribution to the creation and spread of the <em>agege bread</em> by the introduction of the famous ‘Golden Penny’ brand and lauded the legacy of the international businessman and how his outstanding achievements have contributed immensely to the mega city, that is Lagos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the reception that followed at the Banquet Hall of Eko Hotel and Suites, an even more impressive gathering was witnessed featuring the great and the good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the reception Mr. Paul Gbededo, the Group Managing Director of FMN gave a welcome address. After this, there was a rain of tributes and messages of goodwill from many such as Alhaji Ahmed Joda, Mr. Atedo Peterside and Prof. Jerry Gana. Attendees were taken on a trip down memory lane by an interesting video put together about the life and times of George Coumantros.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to John Coumantaros, son of George Coumantaros and current chairman of FMN, there was no unsolvable problem and the sky was never the limit for his father. He drew parallels between the legacy of George Coumantaros and the Nigerian spirit. He agreed that his father had contributed immensely to the country’s development, but he also acknowledged that the country, Nigeria, particularly gave his father the opportunity to do great work. It was clear that both feed off each other’s spontaneous energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He explained that apart from business interests, George Coumantaros, had a unique love for the Nigeria and her people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a time when commercial farms were being sold in the country because it was either no longer profitable to run them or government policy was not supportive, George Coumantaros resisted all to sell FMN’S 10,000 hectare  Kaboji farm. He kept it for years because he believed that Nigeria would come to realise again the value of its agricultural potential. Today, that decision is paying off. FMN has been able to create so much value from its backward integration efforts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was no better way for the event to be brought to a close than through the words of the current Chairman, John Coumantaros: “If my father were here today. He would encourage Nigerians not to shy away from the problems but to face them head on and hold the courage to do the right thing. We will work hard to maintain his legacy and vision for the benefit of the nation and its people”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2<sup>nd</sup> of December 2016 was truly a remarkable day as it celebrated the life of a remarkable man, an icon of industry and an entrepreneur par excellence. He will be sorely missed…</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recent research  claims that there is a link between gender and organizational performances. While people argue and provide a myriad of reasons why one gender performs better than the other, one important factor to note is that diversity that is properly channelled will always improve general performance.</p>
<p>For the FMN Group, diversity is beyond our business scope, it runs across everything we do This is why we explore diverse solutions to everyday problems.</p>
<p>The notion “what a man can do, a woman can do better” does not apply to FMN. Rather, what applies is &#8220;what a person is equipped for, a person can do better&#8221;. This core strategy is geared at empowering, improving and employing local expertise in the discharge of duties. This is evident in our programmes with foreign technical partners for the training of young Nigerians, both male and female. FMN strongly believes that by balancing the scales of equality, both men and women have equal chances to contribute at work, home and the nation as a whole.</p>
<p>FMN’s vacancies and promotions are not filled based on any gender prejudices but on its strong core values: Performance, Initiative, Integrity, Leadership, Ownership and Teamwork (PIILOT). We believe when employees are happy at their jobs, work becomes profitable and life becomes more fulfilling. In line with our vision of strengthening skill development across both genders, FMN is set to launch a leadership academy that provides robust curriculums for every role in the organization. This is intended to provide learning opportunities for every employee while also empowering local hands to engender local growth.</p>
<p>FMN understands that since women put more hours into household activities than men, it is unrealistic to expect women at the workplace every day of the week. In order to balance this, FMN has a range of flexible SME opportunities for women across Nigeria which will require less time but will yield inestimable dividends.</p>
<p>From start to finish, FMN is committed to creating value across the Nigerian economic sphere through its farms, factories, and a host of other investments. Moreover, through its dedicated human resource initiatives, it is creating jobs and better lives for over 12,000 direct employees, 5,000 farmers and many SMEs across Nigeria.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Chairman, Board of Directors and Management of Flour Mills of Nigeria PLC (FMN) have announced with deep regret, the death of the founding father of the Company and Chairman Emeritus, Mr. George Stavros Coumantaros. He passed on peacefully in his sleep on Monday, 17th October 2016, in Athens, Greece, at the age of 94.</p>
<p>Mr. Coumantaros is a visionary and dynamic leader, who founded Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc in September 1960. The company pioneered flour milling in Nigeria when its first mill was commissioned in Apapa in 1962. Today, the Apapa milling complex has grown to become one of the largest single site mills in the world. Due to Mr. Coumantaros’ passion and absolute commitment to Nigeria’s economic growth and development, FMN has been positioned as the foremost food and agro- allied group in the country.</p>
<p>George Coumantaros, a rare breed, will be sorely missed by Shareholders, Directors, Management, Employees and Customers of Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc for his vision, inspiration, dynamism, forthrightness, courage and passion which laid the foundation for “The FMN Dream”.</p>
<p>The greatest tribute that Directors, Management, and Staff of the FMN can pay to Mr. George Stavros Coumantaros is to carry on with his legacy of hard work and commitment to the advancement of the Company and Nigeria’s economy.</p>
<p><strong>MR. PAUL GBEDEDO<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since its incorporation in 1960, developing the capacity of local production has been a key focus of the FMN business operation in Nigeria. For more than five decades, the leading food and agro-allied business in Nigeria has invested billions of dollars in the Nation’s quest to produce high quality and affordable products from local raw materials. This is in order to boost self-sufficiency, diversify the economy, reduce the nation’s reliance on imports, save foreign exchange, and provide the nation with valuable exports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, several products from the dominant food and agro-allied company in Nigeria are the embodiment of Made-in-Nigeria. TFI High-Quality Cassava Flour, Golden Penny Oil, and Golden Penny Sugar are produced from scratch to seal by raw materials that are locally sourced to meet the nation’s demand for quality and affordability giving previously dominant imports a run for their money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>High-Quality Cassava Flour is milled at Thai Farm International in Ososa, Ogun State with raw materials from Shao Farm. Shao Farm is the largest commercial cassava farm in Nigeria with over 5,000 hectares of arable land in Shao village just outside Ilorin, Kwara State. The harvested cassava tubers are supplied primarily to Thai Farm International (TFI) cassava flour plant . Today, FMN is the largest producer of High-Quality Cassava Flour in the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Golden Penny Soya Oil, Golden Penny Pure Vegetable Oil, and Golden Penny Margarine are produced at ROM Oil. The Mill in Ibadan, Oyo State operates one of the largest new generation multi oil complexes not only in Nigeria, but the continent as a whole. Premium soya oil is extracted from soybeans sourced from our farm at Kaboji, Niger State and also from farmers all across the middle belt of Nigeria. In June 2015 when Central Bank added Margarine to its not-valid-for-forex list, FMN prevented the void that would have been felt by becoming the first company in Nigeria to produce Margarine locally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In continuation of these commitments to the Nigerian economy, FMN is a key participant and sponsor of the ongoing 22nd National Economic Summit. This year’s summit tagged <strong>“Made-in-Nigeria” seeks to explore vast opportunities inherent in the economy that would be unlocked by a shift of mindset and preference from foreign products.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Monday, 10<sup>th</sup> of October, 2016, President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR declared the summit open and embarked on an exhibition tour with his ministers to see the various companies that have demonstrated a commitment to Made-in-Nigeria. He made his first stop at the foremost food and agro-allied company in Nigeria. The Chairman, Mr. John G. Coumantaros was on hand to show Mr.  President the tangible results of FMN’s commitments to Made-in-Nigeria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expectations are high for the 22nd Nigerian Economic Summit tagged Made-in-Nigeria. However, it is another reminder that the growth of the economy is a collective responsibility. With continuing commitments from all quarters, Nigeria’s quest for self-sustenance is closer than ever.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FMN held its 56th Annual General Meeting at Jasmine Hall, Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos on Thursday, 8th September, 2016.</p>
<p>In spite of the strong economic headwinds and tough business environment, devaluation of the Naira and unrest in the North East, Flour Mills Group had an inspiring year wherein Group Revenue grew by 11% from its 2015 figures of #7.7 billion to #11.5 billion. Group Profit After Tax was #14.4 billion, 71.4% higher than #8.4 billion of 2015 financial year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Company Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc., posted a Revenue of #248 billion, a growth of 8% over the #230 billion of last year. Impressively, the Company’s Profit Before Tax grew by 589% to #6.2 billion from the #0.9 billion posted last year, whilst Profit After Tax grew by 334% to #10.4 billion from #2.4 billion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cost of sales was impacted by impacted by higher cost of foreign currency market deregulation resulting in closing in closing blended exchange rate of #295 to $1 as CBN rate of #197.50. The Company was able to offset the impact of the foregoing on its bottom line only by gradual increase in selling prices of its products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our management is determined to further restructure our operations, streamline our business operations to focus on core businesses and constantly monitor and manage our costs optimally to hedge against further economic challenges, which might evolve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are resolute in ensuring that sustainable returns and dividends from the Group’s agro allied investments are properly harnessed by maximizing local content in the Group’s products, bye – products and processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our confidence in the future prospect of our Company is demonstrated by the fact that despite daunting economic challenges to our business, our directors are proposing to our shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the declaration of  a total of #2.62 billion (2015 – N5.5 billion) representing Dividend payment of N1.00 (2015 – N2.10) per ordinary share of  50 kobo each. The dividend is to be declared out of accumulated pioneer profits and will therefore not be subjected to withholding Tax deductions. We wish to assure our esteemed shareholders of our commitment to delivery superior shareholder value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the year FMN increased its already substantial investment in its Agro Allied businesses where it now grows and processes maize , soy beans, sorghum, sugar cane, palm oil rice, cassava and poultry and our dominant supply of Fertilizer and Agric Sacks to the Nigerian market. FMN continues to be one of the major promoters of the Agricultural Transformation Agenda of the Federal Government with its on-going agro-allied investments aimed at creating jobs and stimulating economic activities in urban and rural area. FMN’s goal is to be involved at all stages of food value chain where a profitable and sustainable Agro-Allied platform of cultivating and processing locally produced raw materials  will ensure the growth and success of our Food Business. We are mindful of the importance of our agricultural operations to be profitable, sustainable and environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We shall continue to leverage on the unassailable quality of our flagship product, Golden Penny Flour; the growing popularity and market acceptability of our sugar brand; our continuous investment in new milling technology; our major investment in Agro Allied businesses; development and introduction of new products in response to evolving consumer expectations; and our strengthened Pan Nigerian products distribution network to generate improved earning and deliver superior shareholder value.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc (FMN) has donated the sum of N60million towards the setting up of Flour Mills Food Research Centre at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Research Centre which is a partnership between FMN and the University of Ibadan as part of its corporate social responsibility thrust which has a strong focus on education, research and skills development, environmental sustainability, health and welfare, infrastructural development and security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first installment of N30million was provided during the flag off ceremony of the centre in March 2013. The second tranche of N30million was handed over during a recent courtesy visit to FMN’s Corporate headquarters. The visitors from the ivory tower included Professor Idowu Olayinka, the Deputy Vice Chancellor (Academics); Professor Charles Aworh, Professor of Food Technology and Dr. Rahman Akinoso, Acting Head of the Department of Food Technology of University of Ibadan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Group Managing Director, Mr. Paul Gbededo, who received the delegation along with Alhaji Olalekan Saliu, the Company Secretary/Director, gave a presentation on the rapid growth, diversification, and transformation within the company. The FMN Group now comprises 24 corporate entities in three divisions: the Food, Agro-Allied, and Logistics/Support Divisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He stated that the Food and Agro-Allied divisions account for 95% of total sales and that FMN was pursuing an aggressive investment plan in agro-allied initiatives, cultivating cassava, sugar cane, oil palm, rice, soya beans and maize in commercial scale in different parts of the country.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1077" src="http://localhost/fmn/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/UI-Food-Centre.jpg" alt="ui-food-centre" width="1280" height="857" srcset="https://fmnplc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/UI-Food-Centre.jpg 1280w, https://fmnplc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/UI-Food-Centre-300x201.jpg 300w, https://fmnplc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/UI-Food-Centre-768x514.jpg 768w, https://fmnplc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/UI-Food-Centre-1024x686.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>He talked about FMN’s 10,000-hectare Kaboji Farm in Niger State where 4,500 hectares have been dedicated to maize, 200 hectares to cassava and 1,500 hectares of soya cultivation.  At Sunti in Niger State, the Group’s sugarcane estate (under centre pivot irrigation) will be producing more than 100,000 tonnes of sugar by 2017.  This farm supplies raw materials to FMN’s sugar refinery which is the second-largest sugar refinery in Nigeria. Also in Sunti, 5,000 hectares of rice fields are being cultivated. Other agricultural projects are also springing up in other parts of the country including Oyo, Kwara and Edo States.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This backward integration policy, he stressed, is to strengthen the Group’s Food business and to align with the Federal Government’s Agricultural Transformation Action Plan. He also mentioned the huge investment in edible oil processing and animal feeds with its plant in Ibadan which is the largest in the country.  He also said that between 2013 and 2018, over N200 million has been planned for investment to boost its Agro-Allied business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Responding, Professor Charles Aworh, Professor of Food Technology, commended the efforts of the Group, especially in strengthening the weak industry-academic linkage in Nigeria, and promoting greater collaboration between FMN and the University of Ibadan.  He called for the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding for greater collaboration whereby students could be exposed to practical aspects of Food Technology through short-term industrial attachments where they will learn about new processes and developments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Receiving the cheque on behalf of the University of Ibadan, Professor Charles Aworh promised that the money would be applied appropriately to the objectives it was intended for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Centre will be equipped with state of the art facilities and would be available to researchers and students from all over Nigeria.  It will assist in determining the shelf life of products, reduce post-harvest food losses and food wastage, promote food sufficiency in Nigeria and reduce food importation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In continuation of our dedication to healthcare, we organized a two-day Free Eye Screening exercise for people within the Apapa community and its environs. The program was carried out in collaboration with the Department of Ophthalmology, Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH). The screening which took place at Apapa Local Government Town Hall, recorded more than 1000 participants who were examined by highly skilled Ophthalmologists, Doctors, and Nurses. Also, participants were provided with recommended free eye medication and spectacles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The screening program which took place on the 4th and 5th of December 2013, at Apapa Local Government Town Hall, recorded more than 1000 participants who were examined by highly skilled Ophthalmologists, doctors, and nurses. In addition, participants were provided with recommended free eye medication and spectacles by Flour Mills.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1073" src="http://localhost/fmn/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FMN-Free-Eye-Screening.jpg" alt="fmn-free-eye-screening" width="1280" height="859" srcset="https://fmnplc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FMN-Free-Eye-Screening.jpg 1280w, https://fmnplc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FMN-Free-Eye-Screening-300x201.jpg 300w, https://fmnplc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FMN-Free-Eye-Screening-768x515.jpg 768w, https://fmnplc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FMN-Free-Eye-Screening-1024x687.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>The Group Managing Director of Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc., Mr. Paul Gbededo, stated in his welcome address that the primary goal of the Eye Care Initiative was to help save, nourish and maintain the sight of participants, particularly those who might not have the means to visit hospitals and eye clinics.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Gbededo, the caring of the eye initiative should assist participants to assess the status of their eyes, and this would surely leave a lasting impression in their minds. He urged them to take full advantage of the opportunity afforded to them to review their visual health and learn healthy living habits which would lead to a general state of well-being.</p>
<p>Some of the participants remarked that the exercise was a great relief to them regarding saving cost and time as they could not cope with the stress of numerous appointments at hospitals and eye clinics. They expressed gratitude for the opportunity given by FMN and urged other companies to emulate the wonderful kindness shown by FMN to bring more health care facilities to their neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The company, in expressing its gratitude, acknowledged the support of officials from the Apapa Local Government Council, in the organization of the exercise by providing a conducive environment for both the people and the doctors, thus making the exercise a huge success.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Nigeria, ‘oil money’ has been at the centre of national discourse in the last four decades. It has captured the imagination of Nigerians across divides for one singular reason: Oil has been the symbol of power, wealth, opulence, growth, and development.</p>
<p>Arguably, everything that is lovable about Nigeria today is a direct consequence of oil wealth. So our preoccupation with oil is apparently justified.</p>
<p>However, like most love interests, there comes a time when things start to go sour; when the fireworks begin to sizzle. Crude oil appears not to be as alluring to the west as it once was, and the result is, our beloved oil money is not as buoyant as it once was.</p>
<p>And what do we do in times like this? Do we look for new love interests, or we go back to neglected or abandoned ones?</p>
<p>Before oil was discovered, agriculture was the mainstay of our economy. At one time it accounted for almost 70 percent of our Gross Domestic Product, and provided the basis for some of our major infrastructural accomplishments. In other words, we were as dependent on agriculture back then as we are on oil today.</p>
<p>Agriculture provided for Nigeria: jobs were available, social infrastructure and amenities were built. The economy was vibrant. As the world&#8217;s largest producer of groundnut and palm oil in the 1960s, the second largest exporter of cocoa, and the supplier of 65 percent of tomatoes consumed in West Africa, agriculture had a great future laid out for us all. Sadly, this is no more the case. The power of oil and our fixation on it have made us forget how important agriculture was to us at the beginning.</p>
<p>Oil is not what it used to be again! A slump in crude prices, Nigeria&#8217;s mainstay, has seriously impacted public and private finances, the naira currency, inflation rates and general welfare of Nigerians all across the various social classes. Presently, crude oil sales account for more than 70 percent of government revenue, and with any sneeze in price, governments at both local and federal levels across Nigeria catch a cold!</p>
<p>Compounding the impact of low oil prices, attacks by militants on oil and gas installations in Delta, Bayelsa, and Akwa Ibom have cut crude production by over one million barrels per day (bpd) to slightly above 1.1 million barrels per day. The government&#8217;s 2016 budget assumed 2.2 million barrels per day production level.</p>
<p>With oil disappointing us presently, we have been left wondering what could have been if we never took our foot completely off the agriculture pedal. Fortunately, all is not lost! So we can go back. Over the years Nigeria has made numerous commendable efforts in that respect.</p>
<p>Sunti Farm is one of the many ways that FMN is contributing to this development. Sunti Farm is a 16,000-hectare sugar and rice plantation close to the town of Mokwa in Niger state. It is operated by Golden Sugar Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of FMN with the purpose of producing milled sugar for local consumption and export. Aside from cultivating sugar cane and rice, the estate also includes mills and a refinery for processing harvested crops.</p>
<p>With sugar being an indispensable part of the Nigerian diet, this is an important investment. The climate, soil, drainage, access to irrigation and availability of labour all work together to impact favourably on crop production and yield.</p>
<p>As an Agro-Allied practitioner, when you discover a right fit such as Sunti is, you make the most of it. The first phase of our sugar operation comprised 3, 000 hectares of sugar cane, and 250 hectares of rice. The second phase comprised a further 3,000 hectares and effectively serves in the expansion of our sugar production. Since we established Sunti farms, it has grown in scale to cover a whopping 30,000 hectares with the cultivation of thousands of hectares and has attracted technology which was hitherto none existent in the region where it is located.</p>
<p>This carefully conceptualised and executed operation ensures that in a region that provides an average yield of 60 to 80 metric tonnes of cane per hectare, we succeed in producing yields more than 100 metric tonnes per hectare. Moreover, with brand new state of the art sugar mill, we will maximize sugar recovery and minimize downtime, getting more sucrose per 100 metric tonnes of sugar cane.</p>
<p>In terms of numbers, we have spent well over N40 billion on the investment and in terms of social impact, the Sunti sugar plantation is expected to provide jobs for over 10,000 people once fully developed. It is spreading development to communities in the region where it is located through various social and economic intervention programmes.</p>
<p>We understand that restoring the glory of agriculture will not be an easy feat. As a nation, we have a lot of catching up to do, a lot of skills and specializations to master and a lot of policy challenges to sort and smoothen out. However, with commendable efforts like FMN&#8217;s Sunti Farms, we are well on our way there.</p>
<p>Today, as oil revenue comes in trickles, other opportunities beckon on us.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>April 1980</p>
<p><strong>N0:55K = $1</strong></p>
<p>October -2016</p>
<p><strong>N315: 00k = $1</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The present value of the Naira in the international market is almost unbelievable.</p>
<p>From an exchange rate of N00:55k to $1 in 1980 to a current rate of up to N400 to a dollar in parallel markets, the Nigerian currency is at its all-time low, and this is rocking almost every sector of the economy out of tune.</p>
<p>These are results for a country that largely depends on importation. In 2015, Nigeria spent over $16 billion on importation. 12.5% of these imports were agricultural products. This resulted in inflation and higher cost of purchasing alternatives from local production.</p>
<p>Saving the Naira requires that Nigeria reduces her dependency on crude oil and our importation of foreign goods and these have been the key nodes of FMN quest to boost the nation’s agricultural prowess.</p>
<p>More than fifteen years ago FMN made another commitment towards the country’s self-sufficiency under its Backward Integration Programme. It started infrastructural investments in the production of raw materials that supported local food processing operations.</p>
<p>Making this possible, involved investments worth over $1 billion in the last 5 years. The investments went into projects such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>N15 billion into ROM Oil; the largest soya mill factory in Nigeria.</li>
<li>N40 billion into the development of Sunti Farms; Nigeria’s biggest sugar cane farm and factory.</li>
<li>N850 million into the development of Kaboji maize and soya bean farm in Kaboji.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expansion of our previous Business-to-Business offerings like flour to become Business-to-Customer products. This caused the expansion of Golden Penny Foods into the production of pasta, noodles, snacks, sugar, flour, oil and ball foods.</p>
<p>As a result of all these investments, we can say that our Agro-allied strategy has saved and continue to save Nigeria a considerable amount that would normally be spent on importation of raw materials, as well as on semi-processed raw materials.</p>
<p>In the midst of the crude oil price crash and its ripple effects across the local and global economy, there has never been a better time to save and conserve FOREX than now, and we are proud to be leading this journey.</p>
<p>Our goal to invest another $1 billion in our agro-allied division within the next 3 years should bear testament to that.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nigeria’s reliance on crude oil is once again at the front burner of national discourse.</p>
<p>The country has depended solely on this natural resource for export and foreign exchange earnings for too long. The economy has recently witnessed a significant drop in the commodity’s price. Crude oil sales account for around 70 percent of government revenue and almost 80 percent of the country’s foreign exchange earnings.</p>
<p>Over the years, Nigeria has failed to achieve substantial earnings in foreign exchange from other sources, which has impeded her growth and development.</p>
<p>What was once a main source of revenue to Nigeria and a boost to her foreign exchange earnings &#8211; has now become its main source of instability. The domination of oil as Nigeria&#8217;s economic mainstay has relegated other sources of revenue to the background, and having not given enough attention to alternative sources of income; Nigeria is obviously unprepared to deal with the current economic situation.</p>
<p>With the falling prices of crude in the international market and the attendant effect it is having on public finances, inflation, the Naira and general economic activity, the need to diversify the economy has never been more urgent. No doubt, countless initiatives have been made to reverse this trend, but great strides are still yet to be made. So, what is wrong?</p>
<p>Experts across the country have agreed that what seem to be lacking is commitment; commitment and the attendant investments and sacrifice needed to see us move away from oil to other revenue lifelines. <strong>This commitment</strong><strong> is what we have demonstrated at Kaboji Farms</strong>.</p>
<p>Kaboji is a town located 18 kilometers southwest of Kontagora, Niger State, and is home to one of FMN farms taking on the oil hegemony headlong. Kaboji Farms was not just conceived to support our agro-processing industries; it was developed to aid the Nigerian economy.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, long before the economic impasse which Nigeria currently faces was visible, we decided to look inwards so as to develop channels of locally sourced raw materials; that necessitated the acquisition of a 10, 000 hectare land at Kaboji. This move marked the beginning of our agro-allied operations.</p>
<p>Kaboji farm is one of the largest commercial farms in Nigeria, with maize, cassava, sorghum, and soy as its mainstay. On a yearly basis, it produces 32,000 metric tonnes of cassava, and 8,000 metric tonnes of maize.</p>
<p>Initially established as a joint venture between Northern Nigeria Flour Mills (NNFM) and FMN, Kaboji farms was to provide maize for the NNFM maize mill in Kano before its total acquisition by the FMN Group. Today, Kaboji Farms Limited has increased in scale and scope, with asset investments exceeding N1 billion.</p>
<p>Kaboji Farms is now a 10,000 hectares powerhouse, but over the next 5 years, there are plans to increase the cultivated area by a further 2,000 hectares. This will bring about a projected additional output of 7000 metric tonnes. By using the latest farming techniques and a highly mechanized approach, we will continue to achieve yields that are becoming the reference standard for the individual crops.</p>
<p>Much more than just farm produce, Kaboji Farm has created extensive value within the community. It provides massive direct economic stimulation and employment, thereby helping to alleviate poverty in the area. FMN has built six blocks of classrooms and a police station at Kaboji.</p>
<p>We believe that if we sustain the agricultural growth initiatives that have been embarked on at Kaboji, we will contribute to Nigeria’s food security and self-sufficiency; and also help the country realize its goal of becoming the economic giant in Africa</p>
<p>In the interim, oil may have a tight grip on our economy, but it will not be long before that ceases to be the case. The potential and promise of Kaboji Farms, as well as other initiatives, will see to it that this country is weaned off oil.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recent statistics from the Nigeria Bureau of Statistics (NBS) suggest that over 1.5 million Nigerians became unemployed in the first quarter of 2016, and Nigeria’s unemployment rate grew from 10.4% in the last quarter of 2015 to 12.1% of the labour force in the first quarter of 2016.</p>
<p>To many Nigerians right now, being gainfully employed is all that matters- employment is placed above the three necessities of life. After all, aren’t our food, clothing, and shelter determined by the jobs that we find?</p>
<p>Having a job does not just impact on the individual alone, it tells on the family and the wider society. Being gainfully employed does not only come with the attendant catalytic effect on the economy, but also as an important marker for individual psychological wellbeing. It is a thing of pride to the individual.</p>
<p>But in Nigeria today there are about millions of people who do not have this pride.</p>
<p>This is why at FMN; we are passionate about creating job opportunities and other sources of livelihood for as many people through the various ways our operations touch their lives. This is how we have managed to keep over 11,000 diverse Nigerians employed in our farms, factories and our various lines of businesses.</p>
<p>As a responsible company operating in Nigeria, we recognize that the Government alone cannot provide enough jobs to cater to all the rising employment needs, so the onus rests on us as a private organisation to provide opportunities for Nigerians.</p>
<p>The provision of employment opportunities is one of the cardinal drivers of our Backward Integration Programmes (BIP). Apart from initiatives and investments to transform the nation’s agricultural prowess, boost output and generate much needed foreign exchange, our investment in agriculture is also creating employment opportunities for thousands.</p>
<p>Apart from our farms, we employ thousands more men and women from a broad range of backgrounds in our factories all over the country, while our logistics and support divisions provide sources of living, development and self-worth to many more Nigerians.</p>
<p>Apart from those directly employed in our operations, we have given rise to the establishment of other businesses in the SME sub sector that have provided a source of living for millions. They are the third-party service providers, the distributors, wholesalers, and retailers. For every FMN product, a whole value chain of these people exist, providing thousands of jobs along the line.</p>
<p>From our flour mills, to our oil mills, from our feed mills to our refineries, from the ports to our other supporting logistics businesses – packaging to power, FMN has been recognised as an equal opportunity employer of diverse talent.</p>
<p>By Feeding the Nation Every day, FMN is Fostering Richer Lives.</p>
