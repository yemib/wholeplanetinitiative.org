<li><strong>THEME</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The theme of the 2018 Lagos State Co-operative Federation (LASCOFED) Cooperative Leaders’ Conference is “EXPANDING CO-OPERATIVE FRONTIERS” with the sub-theme, “Co-operative Structure and Governance as a tool for unity.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This annual programme is a strategic forum which enables co-operative leaders and stakeholders come together to review the events of the outgoing year with the view to planning and establishing action plans for the approaching year based on agreed resolutions of cooperators at the conference.</p>
<p>This years’ conference had in attendance participants from all the 21 Multipurpose Co-operative Unions in Lagos State as well as other affiliated associations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HIGHTLIGHTS OF EVENTS</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>REGISTRATION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>At arrival, coo-operators were registered, given souvenirs and checked into their rooms.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>SPEECHES</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The programme proper started on the second day with varieties of speeches and goodwill messages. The LASCOFED President speech and the Permanent Secretary; Ministry of Commerce Industry and Cooperatives formal opening and declaration speech were key among others.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>PLENARYSESSIONS</strong></li>
<li><strong>HEALTH TALK</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A world class health talk and counselling was given by Dr. Olanike Ekekezie. She established her talk on the slogan that, “You are what you eat and drink”.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>GROUP DISCUSSION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Cooperators were divided into six groups with six different topics. After their extensive, thorough and interactive analysis of the topics, the following resolutions were presented:</p>
<p><strong>GROUP 1: UNDERSTANDING LINKAGES AND INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE COOPERATIVE STRUCTURE: RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>That the cooperative structures are the primary societies, the secondary societies and the Federation LASCOFED.</li>
<li>That the linkages are the areas of cooperation and connectivity within the movement which must be in accordance with the established cooperative bye laws.</li>
<li>That areas of interface include: attending meetings and programmes, payment of dues, subscriptions, levies, etc., resolving disputes within and between societies and LASCOFED should be the link of cooperatives to the Ministry/Directorate.</li>
<li>That investment, projects and businesses can be engaged jointly by these structures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GROUP 2:</strong> Discussed the topic “<strong>STATUTORY ROLES OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE CO-OPERATIVE STRUCTURES</strong>”</p>
<p>The group resolved that; Cooperative Stakeholder is a person or group of persons whose action or reaction will affect the image of the society positively or negatively.</p>
<p>That the federation should provide enabling environment for societies and union businesses to thrive, and also to ensure regular and continuous co-operative education of members.</p>
<p>That there is need for separation of roles, functions and powers between the Federation and the Ministry in relating with the primary and secondary Cooperative Societies in line with international standard.</p>
<p><strong>GROUP 3:</strong> This group discussed “<strong>LEGAL INSTRUMENTS FOR CO-OPERATIVE STRUCTURES</strong>”</p>
<p>The group highlighted various legal instruments as;</p>
<ol>
<li>Nigeria Co-operative Society Act</li>
<li>Lagos State Co-operative Society Law</li>
<li>Co-operative Society Bye-Law</li>
<li>Operational Guidelines by the Directorate of Cooperatives</li>
</ol>
<p>This group resolved that these legal instruments must be used as complements and must not contradict or contravene international standard, as cooperative is a global thing and not restricted to Lagos or Nigeria alone. Therefore, these instruments must create room expansion, development and advancement of cooperatives in all ramifications, and must not hinder the afore-mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>Group 4: </strong>The group discussed “<strong>CHALLENGES AND BENEFITS OF UNITY OF THE COOPERATIVE MOVEMENT</strong>”.</p>
<p>The group highlighted individual difference, tribalism,finance, lack of effective communication and government policy as challenges while on the other hand effective communication, expansion and progress are possible benefits that could be derived from our unity.</p>
<p>They reiterated that areas of unity that bind us together should be reinforced at all levels of the Cooperative Movement.</p>
<p><strong>Group 5: </strong>The group discussed “<strong>LASCOFED AS A SYMBOL OF UNITY</strong>”</p>
<p>They reiterated the fact that LASCOFED is an umbrella body for all primary cooperative societies. Thus, LASCOFED should promote effective communication by considering use of other platforms like social media to advocate unity and cohesion.</p>
<p>That LASCOFED should identify with primary societies during AGMs and also provide sustainable assistance to societies where need be particularly on investment opportunity.That LASCOFED and the Directorate should encourage the primary societies to fully identify with their secondary unions and by extension LASCOFED itself.</p>
<p><strong>Group 6: </strong>The group discussed the topic “<strong>MOJODA RESORT: A MUST ACCOMPLISHED PROJECT</strong>”.</p>
<p>This group agreed that the idea of the project is a wonderful and brilliant one; which when accomplished will have unquantifiable multiplier effect on all stakeholders and the Movement.</p>
<p>It resolved that actualizing the project is quite possible through the use of all available legal means and robust sources of finance options, starting with members agreeing to a levy of N1,000 (one thousand Naira) per head of all cooperators in Lagos State. Sales of shares, call for loans, and investment capital that will attract dividends etc.</p>
<p><strong>PLENARY III: PRACTICAL GUIDE AND MANAGEMENT OF BAKERY AND CONFECTIONARIES</strong></p>
<p>As a round off for the plenary sessions, a learn by practice workshop on the baking of bread and confectionaries was held for delegates. All cooperators and guests including the President and all leaders were given apron, cap and glove for the baking practical. It was a session that was unimaginably interesting.</p>
<p><strong>4.0   CONCLUSION/RECOMMENDATION</strong></p>
<p>This communique Committee strongly believes that the six topics discussed at this 2018 Cooperative Leaders’ Conference should be taken as the Movement’s next four (4) year administrative agenda.</p>
<p>All the suggested resolutions by each Committee should be further developed into short and long achievable action plans which will take LASCOFED to the next level of greater heights.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>WELCOME ADDRESS DELIVERED BY THE PRESIDENT OF LAGOS ISLAND MULTIPURPOSE COOPERATIVE UNION.</strong></p>
<p><strong>PROTOCOLS</strong></p>
<p>I am indebted to Almighty God, the giver of life for giving me this opportunity to welcome you all on behalf of Ikeja and Lagos Island Multipurpose Cooperative Unions. It is indeed a pleasure to have you all in our midst today and for the next 2 days. You are most welcome.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Executive Committees and members of the 2 Multipurpose Cooperative Unions and in particular the planning committee, I welcome everyone to this joint retreat. The retreat is an educational program packed with social flavour. Therefore, we shall spice it up with entertainment as we go along.</p>
<p>This is the second time that the 2 MCUs will be collaborating for this kind of programme and sincerely, our individual and collective strengths have been harnessed to give the event a class.</p>
<p>A cocktail party was held last night to usher our esteemed participants and guests into this cozy, world-class and hospitality arena. I hope you had a swell time at the party. The essence of that was to relax and get everyone prepared for the more serious technical sessions which will be held today.</p>
<p>Before we go into the technical session and following this welcome address, we shall listen to the number one cooperator in Nigeria, that is the President of Cooperative Federation of Nigeria (CFN) who also doubles as the President of Lagos State Cooperative Federation (LASCOFED) whom we are privileged to have in our midst today. I am talking about no other person than High Chief Oriyomi Ayeola. Next would the keynote address by the amiable Director of Cooperatives, Mrs. Olufunmilayo Ibraheem, who would also declare the retreat open. Once again, we appreciate you for finding time to be with us today and expectedly throughout the programme. We are eager to have you share your wealth of experience with our distinguished participants.</p>
<p>The retreat is themed “<strong>Expanding Cooperative Frontiers” </strong>in line with the directives of our apex body, Lagos State Cooperative Federation (LASCOFED). The technical session will therefore be centred on this theme with a focus for which my colleagues and I painstakingly selected- <strong>Production and Exportation of Agricultural Goods: A Goldmine Untapped </strong>as topic for discussion<strong>. </strong>This is an educational discourse aimed at redirecting our minds to the various ways we can expand cooperative operations beyond what we are doing now. Our focus is to move from local to national and international collaborations.</p>
<p>In recent times, attention has shifted to the agricultural sector as the area to salvage the nation’s over-dependence on petroleum, thus improving the nation’s economic strength. With the rapid improvement obvious with the agricultural sector, it is pertinent that cooperative societies shifted attention to production and exportation of such goods to the outside world. Simply, investment is required in the agricultural sector, which I believe the Cooperative Movement could venture considering our economic power.</p>
<p>In relation to the above, we shall have an interactive session, which will be used to discuss the impact of the Naira-Yuan Swap and the opportunities for cooperative societies.</p>
<p>We are aware that most of the participants are elderly, therefore we promise not to keep you too long on any particular event. In view of this, today’s session will end before lunch to allow us observe Jumat Prayers or other personal schedules.</p>
<p>In consideration of the importance of health to the well-being of man and functioning effectively in responsible positions which most of us hold, we purpose to continue the programme tomorrow with a Health Walk very early in the morning; before breakfast. I implore us to make this a routine and not one-off. Sincerely, many ailments will be nipped in the bud if we make walking a routine alongside regular check-ups. Provision has been made for medical check after the walk. This will run for about 1-2 hours during which breakfast will be served in the restaurant.</p>
<p>Games competition is planned for noon. This is to exercise the brain and socialize amongst ourselves. We implore us to take advantage of this as we can also network during this period.</p>
<p>Finally, the closing dinner and gala night will be the high point of this 3 days programme which promises to be fulfilling and fun-filled.</p>
<p>Once again, on behalf of the Planning Committee, we are highly honoured by your presence and appreciate each and everyone and particularly all cooperative societies here present. We promise that you will find the time you spend with us highly rewarding.</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Cooperative…Oneness</p>
<p>Cooperative…Power</p>
<p>Cooperative…Progress</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><u>ADDRESS BY THE LASCOFED PRESIDENT, CHIEF ORIYOMI AYEOLA, AT THE 2018 JOINT MULTIPURPOSE COOPERATIVE UNION RETREAT HELD 12<sup>TH</sup> – 15<sup>TH</sup> JULY, 2018.</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>PROTOCOLS</strong></p>
<p>I am thankful and grateful to Almighty God for the privilege to join you at this Joint Retreat holding today. I join the Chairman and Presidents of all collaborative Multipurpose Cooperative Unions to welcome you to this Retreat.</p>
<p>I appreciate the collaboration over the years and which still exists among the MCUs organising the retreat. Your common resolve to jointly hold the retreat is in fulfillment of the aspirations of the Board of LASCOFED that MCUs should jointly organize retreats. I want to implore you that your collaborations should not end here; rather, it should extend to having collaborative businesses for the promotion of unity and synergy among MCUs.</p>
<p>The Board of LASCOFED approved <strong>“Expanding Cooperative Frontiers”</strong> as the theme for the year and should be used by all member-affiliates for all training programmes. Therefore, on behalf of the President-in-Council and Board of LASCOFED, I appreciate the organisers of the retreat for adopting the theme.</p>
<p>The theme was chosen to sensitize cooperative societies and cooperators and initiate action to expand the scope of cooperative operations. It is the passion of the Board of LASCOFED that cooperative societies and cooperators in Lagos State commenced establishment of viable businesses that can contribute meaningfully the economic output of the cooperative society, the economy of Lagos state and improve lives of the cooperators.</p>
<p>Cooperative Movement of Lagos State should be seen at the forefront of establishment of viable cooperative businesses. It is our expectation that by the end of the year, we would realize several cooperative businesses scattered across Lagos State and beyond.</p>
<p>Last year, we launched <strong>LASCOFED CONNECT</strong>, a pet project aimed at promoting better communication within the Cooperative Movement of Lagos State. I am happy to inform you that the communication scheme is still ongoing and working effectively. I want to implore everyone who has not joined the LASCOFED CONNECT platform to do so for us to have a more unified Cooperative Movement.</p>
<p>Dear cooperative leaders, I want to implore everyone to ensure that they pass on whatever is learnt in the course of this retreat to other members of your various cooperative societies. I advise that you consider the retreat as a train-the-trainer programme.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and God bless.</p>
<p>Cooperative…Oneness</p>
<p>Cooperative…Power</p>
<p>Cooperative…Progress</p>
<p><strong>Chief Oriyomi Ayeola</strong></p>
<p><strong>LASCOFED President</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>WELCOME ADDRESS DELIVERED BY THE LASCOFED PRESIDENT, CHIEF ORIYOMI AYEOLA ON THE OCCASION OF THE VISITATION OF THE HONOURABLE COMMISSIONER FOR THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE, INDUSTRY AND COOPERATIVES, MRS. A. OLADUNJOYE ON 27<sup>TH</sup> JUNE, 2018.</strong></p>
<p><strong>PROTOCOLS</strong></p>
<p>On behalf of the Board of Directors and the Cooperative Movement, I heartily welcome you, the Honourable Commissioner and your delegation, to the secretariat of Lagos State Cooperative Federation, the apex body for cooperative organisations in the state.</p>
<p>This Federation evolved from the old, Lagos Co-operative Thrift and Credit Union Ltd which was established in 1952 and registered in 1956 as the parent body for all the cooperative societies in the then Lagos colony. After the creation of Lagos State in 1967, Lagos Co-operative Thrift and Credit Union Ltd became Lagos State Co-operative Union Ltd which was later changed to Lagos State Co-operative Federation Ltd. (LASCOFED).</p>
<p><strong><u>Lascofed Office Complex &amp; Multipurpose Hall</u></strong></p>
<p>The Honourable Commissioner, it delights me to inform you and everyone that this land on which this edifice and other buildings stand today is a product of the struggles of cooperative leaders. This struggle was further complemented with the decision to have a befitting edifice as LASCOFED’s secretariat. Thus, the foundation for this edifice was laid on 15<sup>th</sup> July, 2010 and on 19<sup>th</sup> July, 2016; it was completed and officially commissioned by His Excellency, the Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode.</p>
<p>The building was completed at a total sum of N296,624,820.00 (two hundred and ninety-six million, six hundred and twenty-four thousand, eight hundred and twenty Naira). I am proud to say categorically that majority of the funds used for the construction of this building was from income generated internally while the rest was from development levies from cooperative societies and loans from 10 (ten) cooperative societies. I want to inform you that we have fully repaid some of these loans and we are determined to complete payment before the expiration of this tenure in 2020 by the grace of Almighty God. You will in this regard agree with me that the building is a product of our cooperation.</p>
<p>This building consists of a multipurpose hall on the ground floor, offices on the first and second floor; and the last floor which is a pent house. We hope to repay these loans from income generated from the multipurpose hall and the office rentals.</p>
<p><strong><u>Cooperative Insurance</u></strong></p>
<p>After the completion of the edifice, we never relented on our oars. We made giant strides to improve the well-being of our members in various areas. This resulted in the commencement of a Cooperative Insurance Scheme (CIS) which now has LASACO Insurance Plc as the lead underwriter. We have in the process incorporated LASCOFED Insurance Broker for effective operation of the cooperative insurance scheme.</p>
<p><strong><u>PRAYERS</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Mojoda Land</strong></p>
<p>The Honourable Commissioner, aside the afore-said, I am pleased to also inform you that LASCOFED has 20acres of land at Mojoda, Epe, which we intended to develop for the construction of a cooperative resort. We have been able to do the fencing of the property however we have been having difficulty in taking formal possession of the land in the area of the Certificate of Occupancy. Ma, we would appreciate your assistance in this regard.</p>
<p><strong>Transformer</strong></p>
<p>Since LASCOFED secretariat moved to this building we have been having challenges with electricity. We have been reliably informed that the solution to resolving these challenges is to obtain a transformer. The Honourable Commissioner ma, we therefore seek your indulgence for your assistance in liaising with the Honourable Commissioner for the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources on this issue.</p>
<p><strong><u>APPRECIATION</u></strong></p>
<p>We appreciate the leadership of the Ministry for the cooperation, friendship and constant support to the Cooperative Movement since the cooperative department moved to the Ministry. The enabling environment provided by the government has positively influenced the growth and development of cooperative societies scattered across the state.</p>
<p>The Honourable Commissioner, we are confident that your visitation is an evidence of your avowed determination to acquaint yourself with the affairs and operations of the Cooperative Movement.</p>
<p>Once again, on behalf of all the cooperators in the state, I say thank you for making out time out of your busy schedules to visit the secretariat of the Lagos State Cooperative Movement.</p>
<p>We wish you a successful stay in office and many more years of devoted service to the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Cooepratives.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Chief Oriyomi Ayeola</p>
<p>LASCOFED President</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>ADDRESS DELIVERED BY THE PRESIDENT OF LASCOFED CHIEF TAJUDEEN ORIYOMI AYEOLA AT THE OPENING CEREMONY OF THE 2018 LASCOFED COOPERATIVE LEADERS CONFERENCE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Protocols</strong></p>
<p>On behalf of all members of the Board of Lagos State Cooperative Federation, I welcome you all to the 2018 Cooperative Leaders Conference.</p>
<p>I am particularly grateful to Almighty Allah for sparing our lives to see this day and for his mercies on our various cooperative societies particularly in the past one year.  May His mercies continue to be with each and every one of us.</p>
<p>I want to use this opportunity to welcome the leadership of our regulatory Ministry, Ministry of Commerce Industry and Cooperatives led by the Honorable Commissioner, Barrister(Mrs) Olayinka Oladunjoye to our midst. On behalf of all cooperators in Lagos State, I also welcome the Permanent Secretary, Mr to the Cooperative family. We have no doubt that with your wealth of experience as an administrator, the Cooperative Movement will record remarkable progress and the relationship will be mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>Dear distinguished cooperative leaders,I want to express my gratitude to you all for your support and participation at the ICA Ministerial conference hosted by Nigeria and the 4<sup>th</sup> National Cooperative Summit organized by Cooperative Federation of Nigeria recently. I appreciate the time and resources you put into attending the programs. May God almighty reward all our efforts with success.</p>
<p>In line with the 5<sup>th</sup> cooperative principle; Information, Communication and Education, we are committed to giving members all round education on a continuous basis. Based on this, LASCOFED Training and Development Centre has been re-engineered and I am happy to inform you that the accreditation team from Centre for Management Development inspected our facilities last week and have given us the nod to carry on as a training Institution.</p>
<p>We therefore want to use this forum to inform you that we are prepared to undertake all forms of training for the purpose of increasing knowledge and empowering members to take charge of the economy of this country.</p>
<p>The training programs organized by both LASCOFED and her affiliates in the course of the year were centered on the theme<strong> “Expanding Cooperative Frontiers”.</strong>I must tell you that justice was actually done to it. Members at the various retreats and the LASCOFED free seminar discussed topical issues on how cooperatives can expand their activities. I commend the Multipurpose Cooperative Unions for this.</p>
<p>At this conference, we shall concentrate on two sub themes namely;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cooperative Structure and Governance as Tools for Unity and </strong></li>
<li><strong>Practical guide to Bakery and Confectionary Business.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In order to ensure that Cooperative societies fulfill their mandate to members and that the executive manage the society according to the enabling laws, we need to update ourselves regularly. The conference is therefore posed to address some of the issues that we gathered have been agitating the minds of members on the <strong>Structure and Governance of Cooperative</strong> in an interactive session today. We urge members to participate actively in this session and others for more information and education on the management of cooperative societies.</p>
<p>I urge you to feel free to interact with one another and share experiences.</p>
<p>Once again, I welcome you all to this year conference and wish that we all have happy deliberations.</p>
<p>Chief Oriyomi Ayeola</p>
<p><strong>President</strong></p>
<p><strong>LASCOFED</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong> ADDRESS DELIVERED BY THE LASCOFED PRESIDENT, HIGH CHIEF ORIYOMI AYEOLA AT THE COOPERATIVE LEADERS’ RETREAT ORGANIZED BY IKEJA &amp; LAGOS ISLAND MULTIPURPOSE COOPERATIVE UNIONS HELD 16<sup>TH</sup> – 19<sup>TH</sup> AUGUST, 2018.</strong></p>
<p>I am thankful and grateful to Almighty God for the privilege to join you at this Joint Retreat holding today. It is with delight that I join the Presidents of Ikeja and Lagos Island Multipurpose Cooperative Unions, to welcome everyone to this Cooperative Leaders’ Retreat.</p>
<p>Last year the collaboration between these two MCUs emanated and I am indeed a happy man that the relationship is still maintained this year as a way of promoting the spirit of cooperation among cooperatives. I thank you for the oneness which you have exhibited. This collaboration should not be limited to holding retreats alone, but should be extended to even having joint business enterprises.</p>
<p>Esteemed cooperators I appreciate your support to Lagos State Cooperative Federation. Particularly, I am grateful for your support during my election as Presidency of  This year, the Board of LASCOFED saw the need to make the Cooperative Movement and cooperators operate beyond its present scope. The Cooperative Movement is blessed with immense potentials which needed to be improved and enriched. The present economic output by the cooperatives in the state can be beyond what it is now if only we can think outside the box. This informed why the Board of LASCOFED selected “Expanding Cooperative Frontiers” as the theme for all training programmes in 2018. It is further expected that affiliate-members should conceptualize their training topics from the given theme.</p>
<p>I appreciate the leadership of the MCUs for embracing the theme, thus enhancing the effort of the Lagos State Cooperative Movement towards the attainment of the objectives for this year. I implore you to continue in this stead in future programmes.</p>
<p>Dear cooperators, last year, I sought your support for the Presidency of Cooperative Federation of Nigeria(CFN), the apex cooperative federation, and you all astoundingly came out enmasse enroute to Niger State for the historic victory. As a Cooperative Movement of Excellence, I want to call on you again for your support as Nigeria will be hosting other African cooperatives for the 12<sup>th</sup> Africa Cooperative Ministerial Conference (ACMC) and 13<sup>th</sup> Regional Assembly scheduled for 2<sup>nd</sup> – 7<sup>th</sup> September, 2018 at Nicon Luxury Hotel, Abuja.</p>
<p>Fellow cooperators, LASCOFED Connect, the communication scheme customized to ease the challenges of communication by members of Lagos State Cooperative Movement is already in operation. I implore you to embrace this communication scheme for us to have a more unified Cooperative Movement.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we should remember that the lectures, lessons, skills and knowledge acquired in the course of this retreat should not end here, but rather evoke action as the Cooperative Movement of Lagos State is awaiting our numerous contributions to better the fortunes of the State and Nigeria at large.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and God bless.</p>
<p>Cooperative…Oneness</p>
<p>Cooperative…Power</p>
<p>Cooperative…Progress</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>ADDRESS DELIVERED BY THE LASCOFED PRESIDENT, HIGH CHIEF ORIYOMI AYEOLA AT THE COOPERATIVE LEADERS’ RETREAT ORGANIZED BY IKEJA &amp; LAGOS ISLAND MULTIPURPOSE COOPERATIVE UNIONS HELD 16<sup>TH</sup> – 19<sup>TH</sup> AUGUST, 2018.</strong></p>
<p>I am grateful to God Almighty for the privilege to be here today. With joy and happiness, I join the Presidents of Ikeja and Lagos Island Multipurpose Cooperative Unions, to welcome everyone to this Cooperative Leaders’ Retreat.</p>
<p>Last year, the collaboration between Ikeja and Lagos Island MCUs started and I am indeed happy that the relationship is being maintained this year. This is a good way of promoting the spirit of cooperation among cooperatives. I therefore commend the Executive Committees of these two Unions for the show of oneness being exhibited through this. However, just as I emphasised last year, this collaboration should not be limited to holding retreats alone, but should be extended to having joint business ventures.</p>
<p>Dear esteemed Cooperators, let me appreciate your continuous support to Lagos State Cooperative Federation whch strengthened and reflected on my election as President of Cooperative Federation of Nigeria (CFN). This position surely comes with numerous assignments. One of such comes up this year as the Cooperative Movement of Nigeria will be hosting all cooperatives in Africa for the 12<sup>th</sup> Africa Cooperatives Ministerial Conference (ACMC) and 13<sup>th</sup> Regional Assembly scheduled for 3<sup>rd</sup> – 7<sup>th</sup> September, 2018 at Nicon Luxury Hotel, Abuja.</p>
<p>During the event, Cooperative societies and cooperators in Nigeria will have the opportunity of exhibiting their products and services under the auspices of Cooperative Federation of Nigeria. As a Cooperative Movement of Excellence, I want to call on you again for your support and attendance. Please contact LASCOFED Secretariat for information on how to register and participate in the conference.</p>
<p>The theme of the conference is <strong>Leveraging the Cooperative Advantage for the Africa Free Trade Area</strong>. This is undoubtedly in tandem with the vision of Lagos State Cooperative Movement for 2018 that Cooperative societies and members should make effort to expand their frontiers. It is high time that cooperative societies and Cooperators shifted attention to production as this is one of the ways the Cooperative Movement would achieve its untapped economic potentials. I am aware that some Cooperative societies and Cooperators have begun this diversification, but much still has to be done in achieving this goal.</p>
<p>Once again, I appreciate the leadership of Ikeja and Lagos Island MCUs for embracing the vision of LASCOFED, thus, choosing <strong>Production and Exportation of Agricultural Goods: A Goldmine Untapped,</strong> as the subject of discourse at this retreat. This is also in the direction expected and preached by the Lagos State Cooperative Movement. I want to appeal to everyone here present to endeavour to listen attentively during the lecture which I believe will inform and educate us immensely.</p>
<p>Fellow Cooperators, <strong>LASCOFED Connect</strong>, the communication scheme customized to ease the challenges of communication by members of Lagos State Cooperative Movement is already in operation. I implore you to embrace this communication scheme for us to have a more unified Cooperative Movement.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we should remember that the lectures, lessons, skills and knowledge acquired in the course of this retreat should not end here, but rather evoke further actions as the Government of Lagos State is awaiting our numerous contributions to better the fortunes of the State and Nigeria at large.</p>
<p>I wish our Muslim brothers and indeed everyone, Happy Eid-il-Kabir celebrations in advance.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
<p>Cooperative…Oneness</p>
<p>Cooperative…Power</p>
<p>Cooperative…Progress</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><u>Address Delivered By Lascofed President, Chief Oriyomi Ayeola, At The 2018 International Cooperative Day Celebrations.</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>PROTOCOLS</strong></p>
<p>First and Foremost, I thank God Almighty for the privilege of 2018 International Cooperative Day celebration and for granting us the opportunity to be here today.</p>
<p>On behalf of the President-in-Council and Board of Lagos State Cooperative Federation (LASCOFED), I join the leadership of Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Cooperatives to welcome you all on this occasion.</p>
<p>The Theme for this year’s celebration as handed down by the United Nations and our global apex, the International Cooperative Alliance is Sustainable Consumption and Production of Goods and Services. As a commitment to the achievement of the SDGs, cooperatives all over the world are by this year’s celebration showcasing how they do their business with flull consideration for the environtment. We are enjoined as a movement to do more in this regard as we have no other planet to go, therefore, we need to be responsible in the way we affect the environment.</p>
<p>Dear cooperative leaders, last year we reported to you that we were putting finishing touches to a Memroandum of Understanding between LASCOFED and GLOBACOM for the provision of a Closed-User-Group (CUG) communnication system consisting of voice, SMS and data at a cooperative-friendly monthly rental. I am happy to report to you that the product, LASCOFED CONNECT has been launched and it’s very much in operation now. I urge every one of us to embrace this product so as to maximize the benefit of easy communication within the Cooperative Movement of Lagos State.</p>
<p>The Chairman, Honourable Commissioner, fellow cooperators, Ladies and Gentlemen, on behalf of the Lagos State Cooperative Movement, I wish to appreciate His Excellency, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode for providing the Cooperative Movement with the enabling environment to operate in Lagos State and consequently wish to assure the Governor of our unalloyed loyalty and support.</p>
<p>Once again, I welcome you all and wish you happy celebrations.</p>
<p>Cooperative&#8230;Oneness</p>
<p>Cooperative&#8230;Power</p>
<p>Cooperative&#8230;Progress</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Being The Keynote Address Delivered By Honourable Commissioner, Ministry Of Commerce, Industry And Cooperatives Mrs. Olayinka Oladunjoye, Lascofed Cooperative Leaders Conference Held At Rolak Hotel, Ijebu Ode, Ogun State On Friday 14<sup>th</sup> December, 2018.</strong></p>
<p>I welcome all our cooperative leaders to this annual conference which is aimed at equipping participants with the right tools needed to help make us better in our quest to ensure sustainable development within the Cooperative Movement in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The quest to move the Cooperative Movement forward in a world fraught with so many issues begging for attention and the ability to overcome these for a sustainable future is a real challenge that we must tackle systematically and bring to bear the enormous potential inherent within the movement.</p>
<p>The financial profile of Cooperative Societies in the state should serve as impetus for cooperative leaders to think outside the box and open their minds to business opportunities that can be of collective benefits to members.</p>
<p>We also need to look at Cooperative principles and values as practiced today in order to enhance our deliverables. There must be promotion of sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, reducing inequalities, raising basic standards of living, fostering equitable social development and inclusion as well as the promotion of integrated and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems.</p>
<p>Some of the factors militating against the achievement of the ideals above include but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Poor investment strategies and policies.</li>
<li>Inability to judiciously utilize available funds.</li>
<li>High overheads and running costs.</li>
<li>Lack of modern business techniques i.e. no SWOT analysis, no environmental scanning etc.</li>
<li>Inadequate record keeping.</li>
<li>Difficulty to have legal titles to land by Cooperatives in Agricultural ventures and Estate development.</li>
<li>Lack of impetus and motivation to invest in cutting edge technology and businesses.</li>
<li>Struggle for leadership.</li>
<li>Disloyalty of the part of members.</li>
<li>Inability to access credit.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just to name a few and these issues must be addressed for any progress to be recorded.</p>
<p>To this end, the choice of the theme <strong>‘Expanding Cooperative Frontiers’</strong> is in line with the International Cooperative Alliance’s choice theme for the 2018 International Cooperative Day ”<strong>Sustainable Consumption And Production Of Goods And Services”.</strong></p>
<p>Both themes bring to fore the need to look inwards, realign our priorities and strategize effectively in order to be able to face the challenges ahead.</p>
<p>Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, this conference should help to focus on the attributes needed and actions to be taken, so that cooperators can make the much needed contributions to our economy, especially considering that they are present in all spheres of the economy.</p>
<p>I am optimistic that seasoned speakers have converged here today to do justice and open our minds to areas we need to work on, in order to have the desired impact. It is therefore an opportunity for us as leaders to re-appraise our footsteps and create a sustainable roadmap for the growth of Cooperative movements in Lagos State in particular and Nigeria in general.</p>
<p>On this note, I wish to declare the year 2018 Cooperative Leaders Conference opened.</p>
<p>Long live Lagos State Cooperative Federation!</p>
<p>Long live Nigeria!!</p>
<p>Itesiwaju ipinle Eko lo je wa logun.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The President of Lagos State Cooperative Federation, Mr. Oriyomi Ayeola, has revealed that LASCOFED CONNECT would make communication easier and cheaper for cooperators and their families.</p>
<p>The special closed-user-group (CUG) project which was launched recently at the LASCOFED Multipurpose Hall was conceived out of the need to further improve the welfare of Lagos cooperators. Also, it was identified that ineffective communication is one of the major causes of misunderstandings and misgivings within a cooperative society, which often result into crisis.</p>
<p>While giving his welcome address at the launching, Mr. Ayeola reminded the audience that when he took the reins of LASCOFED administration in 2012, his foremost purpose was ensuring the unity of the Cooperative Movement. He said that this was achieved and he still believed that such unity could be solidified and strengthened when communication is enhanced. Thus, this necessitated the CUG line.</p>
<p>He informed cooperators and guests at the event that LASCOFED partnered with Globacom Ltd while FOJANS Ltd. interfaced between the two parties to provide the CUG lines to cooperators in Lagos State.</p>
<p>Mr. Ayeola explained that the choice of Globacom was due to the antecedents of the communication network and being an indigenous communication outfit that prides itself in developing home-grown communication solutions.</p>
<p>The Public Sector, Head of Department of Globacom Ltd., Mr. Mansur Kayode Opakunle, said that the CUG, LASCOFED CONNECT, is different from the conventional CUG because the package was painstakingly designed for the Cooperative Movement and highly competitive advantages were injected into it. He said that the package has bundled free calls to all networks, monthly free data and some novel Value Added Services.</p>
<p>He further noted that the partnership between LASCOFED and Globacom is geared towards enhancing the efficiency of cooperative societies.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits accrued to the CUG line at a monthly rental of N1000 (One Thousand Naira) includes:</p>
<p>Free CUG calls and SMS</p>
<p>500MB monthly data</p>
<p>Expandable 50minutes on-net calls</p>
<p>50minutes off-net calls</p>
<p>Value Added Services</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Mr. Opakunle, “The (lines) have been designed to accommodate the use of our generic recharge cards which (are) available all over the state and country for reloading and payment for the monthly service rentals.</p>
